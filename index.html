			  <p>In QA, I believe there is no such thing as a trickiest bug; there is only tricky methodology that will discover issues within a project. QA will always test against design of products/projects that is agreed upon by all stakeholders. The environment at your company seems both refreshing and inviting. Understanding and delivering quality products appears to be your top priority, which aligns perfectly with my professional standards and experience. Your tight-knit organization leads me to believe that you are willing to provide a great user experience; this makes all the difference, as I personally disengage from broken products. </p>
